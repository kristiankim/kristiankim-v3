IT WAS A FLEETING CONFRONTATION between two strangers that might have otherwise been forgotten.

But the tussle over a Donald J. Trump campaign sign after a June rally in San Jose, Calif., has already sent one man, Anthony McBride, to jail for six days, and left another, Steven Tong, lamenting the loss of civility in our democracy.

The rally where these two lives collided by happenstance erupted into one of the most violent episodes of this contentious presidential election. Video footage of protesters punching, egging and tackling Trump supporters went viral, sparking outrage among Republicans and soul-searching among Democrats.

Today, the clashes between ordinary people like Mr. McBride and Mr. Tong are playing out in the California courts, in a series of criminal prosecutions brought about as Republican officials accused a city led by Democrats of failing to protect Trump supporters at the rally.

The San Jose rally and its aftermath may be the most powerful illustrations of the dangerous polarization that has gripped the country during the 2016 election.

But a closer look at Mr. Tong, one of rally’s 24 victims, and Mr. McBride, one of 22 people charged with crimes after the event, suggests that there is much that the two men share. The economic struggles and personal dreams that guided them that day are not so different, after all.

On June 2, Mr. Tong woke up in his parents’ house, where he has lived for the past three years, ever since he found himself unable to afford a place of his own.

He is 46, an age he does not like saying out loud because it reminds him how far he is from where he had hoped to be. He had dreamed of becoming a product designer and starting his own company. But art school was too expensive and he left after only a year.

“Companies like Facebook and these so-called social networking companies here in Silicon Valley became the economy,” he said.

“If your occupation is in anything other than that,” he added, “there are not a whole lot of jobs.”

Mr. Tong’s faith in the American Dream has been shaken. But that day, he had a ticket to see Mr. Trump speak about making America great again. Despite the sweltering heat, Mr. Tong parked in the garage at the San Jose Convention Center and walked a few blocks to the rally.

That same morning, Anthony McBride, who is anti-Trump, woke up in his friend’s mother’s apartment, where he has lived for the past three years, ever since he found himself unable to afford a place of his own.

He is 21, too young to carry the stain of life’s disappointments. He dreams of being a fashion designer and starting his own company. But art school is too expensive. He works two jobs — at a car dealership and a clothing store — to save for it.

He also designs shirts that read “BE YRSLF.”

He hopes they will inspire “a movement where people are just being themselves and are not following trends or what society says they have to be,” he said.

Mr. McBride’s faith in the American Dream remains intact, but it is marred by the bigotry that he sees as a product of Mr. Trump’s campaign. On the morning of the rally, Mr. McBride put on a “BE YRSLF” T-shirt and boarded the light rail to the convention center, eager to see for himself what a Trump event was really like.
