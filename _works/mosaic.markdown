# Project Proposal Form Sample

Hello,
I will present you below the details of my working system and I hope that we can work together.

For logo design projects I offer the following options:
• Basic logo design package: up to 4 unique concepts, 3 rounds of revisions - €500 Euros
• Standard logo design package: up to 6 unique concepts, 3 rounds of revisions - €750 Euros
• Unlimited logo design package: unlimited unique concepts - €1250 Euros

I work based on a questionnaire and it takes about 5-7 working days until the first ideas are shared. Depending on the feedback a full logo design project takes about 2 weeks to one month until completion. The project starts in the moment I have your answers and a 50% upfront payment confirmation which is not refundable if the project is started. My preferred payment method is PayPal.

For a consistent look and feel of your identity and brand i recommend you to consider the Stationery Design (letterhead, double sided business card, envelope) while if you plan to work with various printers, web designers, media designers, advertising companies, a Logo Guidelines (usage guidelines for the designed logo) or a Brand Manual (usage guidelines for the new created identity) would be a good idea in order to secure the right usage of the new logo. If it's needed I can also help you find a name for a new project and also a slogan / tagline. If you are interested in any of them please mention and I will give you more details. 


If you have any other questions please let me know and I will answer as soon as possible. If you agree with the terms and you want to continue the project with me in the next step I can send you the questions and also my PayPal account. If you were considering a different budget or a different deadline than the ones mentioned in my answer please let me know them and I will answer with a customized offer based on them.

Thank you again for contacting me, I am looking forward to hear back from you,
Alex
