## This is Head 2

## Bear has three parts 📐
Bear has three main columns where you create, edit, and organize your notes:

* *Sidebar* (on the left): when you add tags anywhere in your notes, Bear will collect them in this sidebar. Think of them like folders you can create and use on the fly, while you write.
* *Notes list* (in the middle): all your notes live here, ordered by modification date. You can *pin a note* to the top of this list for quick access.
* *Editor* (on the right): this is where your magic happens; you're looking at it. 😄


## Bear has style ✒️
Bear supports many text styles like: *bold*, /italic/, _underline_, -strike- and others. You can find shortcuts for them in the *style panel*:

* on a Mac, click on the pen symbol in the bottom right of the Editor
* On an iPhone or iPad, it's in Bear's shortcut bar above the keyboard

Bear also has a range of themes to give you a comfortable, beautiful writing canvas. Some are free, and you can get more with the one-time, in-app purchase of the Pro version. More free and paid themes are also in the works.
