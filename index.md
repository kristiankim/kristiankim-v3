## This is Head 2

## Bear has three parts 📐
Bear has three main columns where you create, edit, and organize your notes:

{% include works.html %}

* *Sidebar* (on the left): when you add tags anywhere in your notes, Bear will collect them in this sidebar. Think of them like folders you can create and use on the fly, while you write.
* *Notes list* (in the middle): all your notes live here, ordered by modification date. You can *pin a note* to the top of this list for quick access.
* *Editor* (on the right): this is where your magic happens; you're looking at it. 😄
